Topic: UI rough Draft
talked about layouts for html design. LT made sketches on his tablet and is going to push them onto the github. Discussed functionality in relation to UI. Will have first SCRUM next meeting. Have a login screen, main page for student, main page for professor, enroll screen, add event screen. Potentially have feature for professor to create event and have it hidden untill a certain date. Professors can add and edit events and view the roster for each class. Students will have a menu to select which classes to display on the calendar. They can also add events and setup notifications for events. The last student feature is to enroll in a class.
